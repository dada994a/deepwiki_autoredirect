Privacy Policy

DeepWiki AutoRedirect does not collect, store, or transmit any personal user data.

The extension operates entirely within the user's browser and only processes the currently opened tab URL to perform redirection between GitHub and DeepWiki.

No data is sent to any server, and no third-party services are used.
