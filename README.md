## Overview

- Redirects the currently opened GitHub repository page to DeepWiki with a single shortcut key.
- Shortcut keys can be freely changed from the Chrome extension settings page (`chrome://extensions/shortcuts`).

## Installation

### For Developers (Install from Source Code)

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open Chrome's **Extensions Management** page (`chrome://extensions/`).
3. Enable **Developer Mode**.
4. Click **Load unpacked**, and select the downloaded folder.

### For Users (Install from Release)

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/dada994a/deepwiki_autoredirect/releases).
2. Download `deepwiki-autoredirect.crx` from the latest release (marked "Latest").
3. Open Chrome's **Extensions Management** page (`chrome://extensions/`).
4. Drag and drop the `.crx` file onto the extensions page.
5. When prompted, click "Add" to install the extension.

> **Note**: Some browsers or Chrome settings may block drag & drop installation.  
> If this happens, please install using Developer Mode.

## Post-Installation Setup (Important!)

Due to Chrome extension specifications, shortcut keys are not set immediately after installation.  
You must manually configure the shortcut key:

1. Go to `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`.
2. Find the **DeepWiki AutoRedirect** section.
3. Set your preferred shortcut key combination (e.g., `Ctrl+Shift+G`, `Ctrl+Shift+H`).

> ⚠️ If you do not set a shortcut key, the extension will not function!
